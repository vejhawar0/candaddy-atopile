Current Goals:

Replace with a single SPI wire
	Find a compatible STM32 that will be able to support the commands.

Replace LCD Panel

Optimize components for capacitors

Potentially resize mounting holes

Double check trace widths to handle 5V

lay components out on the front and back

	Check jlcpcb guidelines for front and back soldering (Price increases, etc.)
Check wifi communication modules
	Based off of the ESP32


Need to replace the LEDS s.t. they are easier to find

Find a way to avoid isolated power modules. Why avoid power isolation modules?


Write up a general document for the Wireless connectivity module
Write justification for the choice of the Stm32 module



overall Notes:

- Currently aimed to find models that owuld be easiest to replace in the design. Thus, looked fo rht eclosest design compatibility and compiled the folliowng list on the Excel sheet.



Justification for the STM32F4 model:
- Still powerful at a cheaper price
- available on LCSC with the same packaging
- Not sure how much memory program will take, 512 KB was on the upper end with a 3$ price tag, justifiable with an immense stock

Parts of Concern:
LCD Panel, not enough to justify 500 orders. 


Nominally: 1500 mA

I_L = 5V / (4.2)*.8 = 2.233 Amps

Currently figuring out the 5V regulator, deciding what the respective part values should be for the TPS61027DRCR
